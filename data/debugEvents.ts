          "A competition for witty creative artists.  If a quick draw and guess is your  major then hands down this event is for you and your team. Only the best minds will draw and conquer while the others will be stuck in their own drawn hurdles. We're back with another event - 'Soles on Fire'! With 3-4 members in a team, this event highlights the excitement of a relay. The 1st member receives a topic and they should draw as understandably as possible on a chart provided by us. The second member enters 15 minutes later, and continues to draw, in turn, trying to guess the topic. Each member continues to do the same until the members have completed their time limit. The total duration is 1.5 hours, and supplies must be brought by the participants. An important note here is that the 1st member cannot communicate with remaining members. The group needs to guess the topic as they continue to draw.",
